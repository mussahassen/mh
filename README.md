# Mussa Hassen

### About Me
Hi I'm Mussa Hassen, an undergraduate student in the field of Data Science, at Colorado State University. I am specializing in mathematics of data science and machine learning. For me data science is about signifying signals and decomposing variance.

Recent courses that I have enjoyed include: Optimization Methods in Data Science, Statistical Machine Learning, and Abstract Algebra. I am looking forward to a first course in Advanced Calculus, Inferential Reasoning in Data Analysis, and a second course in Linear Algebra. 

I've participated in various research projects as an undergraduate research assistant (listed below). My research interest are fairly broad, but recently I've been looking at Interpretable AI (with emphasis on Feature extraction / feature engineering); Mathematical modeling; Operations research (systems engineering); Experiment design (statistical modeling); Causal inference and more. 

I enjoy playing/watching sports (basketball and soccer), journaling, good food, and spending time with friends.
