            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi I'm Mussa Hassen, an undergraduate student in the field of Data Science, at Colorado State University. I am specializing in mathematics of data science and machine learning. I am fortunate to be mentored by <a class="ref-link" href="https://www.math.colostate.edu/~king/">Dr. Emily J. King</a>.</p>
            <h4>Interests</h4>
            <p>Recent courses that I have enjoyed include: <em>Optimization Methods in Data Science, Statistical Machine Learning, and Abstract Algebra.</em> I am looking forward to Advanced Calculus, Inferential Reasoning, and Linear Algebra II.</p>
            <p>I've participated in various research projects as an undergraduate research assistant. My research interest are fairly broad, but recently I've been looking at Interpretable AI (with emphasis on feature extraction or feature engineering); Applied Math (Mathematical modeling, Operations research [or systems engineering]); Experiment design (statistical modeling); Causal inference and more.</p>
            <h4>Outside of research</h4>
            <p>I had an early obsession with Legos; I rarely followed the manual (sometimes made my own). I thought I should dedicate my life to legos up until I got introduced to video games, sports, and life problems. In my free time, I enjoy playing/watching sports (basketball and soccer), journaling, good food, and casual walks. I'm interested in reading interdisciplinary approaches to dialectics of philosophical and social concepts.</p>

            <h2>Data Science to Me is...</h2>
            <p>There are many ways to model and further understand the systems of real-world problems using mathematical models.  </p>
            <p>The systems we may (not) see in our lives, from the growth of a species population, to effectiveness of a policy or an advertisement; or testing a new drug, can be modeled by  ubiquitous mathematical/statistical frameworks. For example differential equations: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>A model developed by Alfred Lotka and Vito Volterra in the 1920s, uses a pair of first-order nonlinear differential equations to describe how a predator and its prey, interact over time.</li>
                <li> The Susceptible-Infected-Recovered model, developed by William Ogilvy Kermack and Anderson Gray McKendrick, is the cornerstone of modern epidemiology. It puts a population into three compartments. Then it uses equations to track how individuals move between them based on the infection and recovery rates.</li>
                <li>Even a simpler example, regression: when testing a new drug, researchers use ANOVA to determine the relationship between the dosage and the physiological effect.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>and so much more. How these functions and operations came about to model such "Deterministic Chaos" in these systems we often overlook, is what I'm intrigued by. </p>
